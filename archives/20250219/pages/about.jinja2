        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            Like I said before on my main page, I'm Benjamin (known as iiPython just for the hell of it really) and I'm a software developer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I write random programs, websites, whatever I feel like really and then deploy it for the internet to look at.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            In addition to normal computer science, I'm a heavy fan of the cybersecurity and cryptography fields and plan to major in
            one (<i>or both!</i>) of them. I also believe privacy is a basic right and take mine very seriously.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So far, I'm RHCSA and Security+ certified, with hopefully more on the way and I plan on joining the Air Force (to help pay for expensive ass college).</p>
