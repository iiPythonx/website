# iiPythonx/website

This is the source for my website, [iipython.dev](https://iipython.dev).  
It's built as needed and deployed as a static site through [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/).

---

Building it is as simple as installing [Nova](https://github.com/iiPythonx/Nova), and then running `nova build`.  
The configuration is available in `nova.toml`, which configures minification and single page routing.
