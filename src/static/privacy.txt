1. No information of any kind is collected by any of my services. I don't even have
a place for you to select a username or fill out an address form.

2. No access logs of any kind are kept for my public services. NGINX has been
configured to log errors only, and even then the only information stored is the
access time and URL (no ip, no user-agent, nothing).

3. No data is sold. As stated above, I store nothing so there's nothing to sell.

4. Note that some endpoints (notably wss://lan.iipython.dev/now-playing) are
proxied through CloudFlare and are therefore subjected to the CloudFlare privacy policy.

    This policy is available here -> https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/

5. Any questions about any of this can be sent to: ben <at> thiswebsite <dot> tld.
                                             (gotta stop the bots from scraping it somehow)

Hark! O gentle user, lend thine ear,
To learn of privacy, without a fear.
In this digital realm, where shadows creep,
Thy data shall be safe in restful sleep.

No logs, no trace, no whisper left behind,
No IPs to track, no sleight of mind.
No cookies here to trail thy merry way,
Nor cross-site spies to lead thee far astray.

For services local, storage pure and clean,
Nought but thy data in the local scene.
No stranger bits amidst thy treasure trove,
In sacred storage, only what thou strove.

And lo! From yonder edge, thy service springs,
Swiftly it comes on angel's wings.
No need to tarry at the server's door,
For from the edge, it cometh evermore.

Thus, in this realm where privacy holds sway,
Thou shalt find peace and rest each passing day.
No prying eyes shall pierce thy digital veil,
For in this world, thy privacy shall prevail.
