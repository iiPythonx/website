            Hi. I'm Benjamin, <br>
            I'm a software developer, sysadmin, cybersecurity analyst and privacy enthusiast.
            <br>
            <br>
            This website serves as my personal space on the internet where I share random projects,            host infrastructure, and more. For more information, check the <a>Github Page</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've been programming for around 10 years and know about 8 independent programming languages,
            the most notable being Python, Javascript, & Lua.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            I heavily enjoy system administration, software development, & networking. <br>
            On the not so computer related side of things, I like watching:
            <ul>
                <li>TV Shows (such as <a href = "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1839578/" class = "link-invert">Person of Interest</a>)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Call me a weeb and you will regret it.</li>
                    <li><s>This sites' accent color is <a href = "https://www.turner.co.jp/ayanamiblue/">Ayanami Blue</a>, lmao.</s></li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <br>
            I also really like rain and storms, for some reason.
