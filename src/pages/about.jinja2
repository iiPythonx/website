        <h2>Background</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Like I said before on my main page, I'm Benjamin (known as iiPython just for the hell of it really) and I'm (primarily) a software developer. <br>
            I write random programs, websites, whatever I feel like really and then deploy it for the internet to look at.
            <br><br>
            In addition to normal computer science, I'm a heavy fan of the cybersecurity and cryptography fields and plan to major in
            one (<i>or both!</i>) of them. I also believe privacy is a basic right and take mine very seriously.
            <br><br>
            So far, I'm RHCSA and Security+ certified, with hopefully more on the way.
